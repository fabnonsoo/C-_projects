// DECONSTUCTORS IN C++.... 

// A Deconstructor is a code that runs automatically upon the destruction of your object.
// As soon as you create your "OBJECT", your constructor runs but as soon as you delete your "OBJECT", your deconstructor runs...
// A Deconstructor is always added in the header file (MyDeconstructor.h)..



#include <iostream>

#include "MyDeconstructor.h"
#include "MyDeconstructor.h"



int main()
{

	Deconstructor so;

	std::cout << "Procastination is self-destructive \n";
	

	std::cout << "Print x: "  << "\n";


	std::cin.get();
