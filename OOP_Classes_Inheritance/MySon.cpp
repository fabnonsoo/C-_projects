// INHERITANCE:- In Inheritance, there's no need for writing any code here because the derived class (Son) has inherited all that belongs to the Base class (Father) in MySon.h

// This is the implementation file
// It contains the method definitions......


#include <iostream>
#include "MyFather.h"
#include "MySon.h"
